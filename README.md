# 1.Why? #

This project was born from a need, so this can be used daily by everybody.     
***

# 2.Structure #

There are 2 main categories:     
		
1. for _**usual**_ (normal) daily tasks, for example, go to Facebook/YouTube/Google homepage and there you can login and you can start your daily routine...   

2. for a _**geek**_ (like me) daily tasks, where you can play with CMD/Registry/Services and other stuff for real fun or just to make a job task...

# 5.Conclusion #

This project was made for personal use, but if you have parents/grandparents/brothers who can't find those commands in Windows, this app will be awesome choice to hang the voice 'Hei, ... where is Paint/where is Facebook homepage/where ... ???'
